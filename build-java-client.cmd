REM The swagger api specification generated by the maven script.  Can also be a URL.
set swagger_opts=-i api\era-pas.json
REM http://localhost:8080/i2ecws/v2/api-docs/swagger.json

REM Directory where templates for package.json and ng-package can be found
set template_opts=-t templates\Java

REM Values set in config_opts can also be passed in via -Dname=value in sys_opts below. Command line 
REM values will NOT override values set in the file below
set config_opts=-c .\config.json

REM Specify the output directory. Right now, we're treating it as a library, but that's somewhat
REM arbitrary. It could just as easily be the root project in the workspace.
set output_opts=-o projects\era-pas\java-client

REM Specify the target language for the generated API
set lang_opts=-l java

REM Set additional options here.  These are what would normally go in config.json above.
set sys_opts=-DnpmVersion=2.0.0 -Dsnapshot=false

REM Additional properties that can be read by the mustache templates
set misc_opts=--additional-properties apiVersion=2.0.0,author="I2E Grants Management",skipHttpImport=true

set version=3.0.35
